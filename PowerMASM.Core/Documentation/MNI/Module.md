# Modules 
With Micro-Assembly, MNI or Module Native Interface is the way to interacting with the outside world besides SysCalls.

Since PowerMASM extends Micro-Assembly with powerfull QOL features, we took a new approach to this design.


PowerMASM's Extended MNI Provides developers with new QOL features such as:
- Manual and Automatic type conversion.
- Class based Constructors and deconstructors
    - useful for setting up and cleaning after the VM Starts/Stops
- Class based static variables
    - useful for setting up and cleaning after the VM Starts/Stops
- Return types for functions
